          <p> Hello again! I am no preacher but some knowlege has to be imparted. So here I list some of the traits one must build in himself/herself in order to lead a life of contentment and to improve the lifestyle and take it to the next level:</p>
          <ol>
               <li>Give yourself some time everyday and analyze yourself. Accept and work on your flaws along with admiring your best qualities.
               <li>Along with being a good orator, it is equally important to be a good listener. Patience is a key to it.
               <li>Having control over oneself or in other words having self-control is a vital quality that a person should possess but is equally challenging. So work towards it a little bit every passing day.
               <li>There are certain other qualities pertaining to being a reliant and trustworthy person. Some of them are as follows:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Be careful and aware of all your responsibilities you have or whatever is expected of you by others.
                         <li>Do your best to avoid procastination. What is needed to be done at the instant, try not to avoid it but do it at that very moment.
                         <li>Do not break your promises.
                         <li>Sincerity towards everything and everyone worthy is the most important.
                    </ul>
          </ol>
          <form>
               <input name="name" type="text" placeholder="First Name">
